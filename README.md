# Coq Tactics "Cheat Sheet"

This is a bunch of material on Coq tactics I cobbled together from various sources while taking a course based on Benjamin Pierce's *Software Foundations*, because I kept forgetting how things work. All code snippets are in Org Babel, so the examples are runnable if Proof General set up, and you can step through everything interactively. Found a mistake? Know a better way? Want to make this even longer? PRs are welcome.
